Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.
We all think we know how the world works. But we've all only experienced a tiny sliver of it.
Luck & risk are siblings.
Luck & risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can't believe in one without respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people & infinite moving parts.
