A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.
Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.
We all think we know how the world works. But we've all only experienced a tiny sliver of it.
Luck & risk are siblings.
Luck & risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can't believe in one without respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people & infinite moving parts.
If you give luck & risk their proper respect, you realize that people's financial success- both your own & others'-it's never as good or as bad as it seems.
We usually attributes someone else's failure to bad decisions, while our own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk.
The line between "inspiringly bold" & "foolishly reckless" can be a millimeter thick & only visible with hindsight.
